Just a brief overview, the diagrams folder just contains some of the diagrams I used for my presentation, the ESP32MQTT.zip folder is a project folder for wokwi, it is a browser based simulator for IOT stuff you can find it at [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com), some parts are currently not working on the simulator due to some functions being locked behind a paid subscription, but you should be able to run it locally on an actual board (hopefully), I also left my presentation in the folder so you guys can just refer to it if you want for some quick help, the NodeRed_Dashboard.json file is a quick dashboard I made using Node Red ([NodeRed getting started](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local) this link cointains some information on how to install and run it), it can communicate with a MQTT broker so you can just change some settings to your broker and it should run normally, its a block based system so it should be pretty easy for you to get the hang of it and change to your liking ([NodeRed MQTT help](https://cookbook.nodered.org/mqtt/connect-to-broker) this link has more help on connecting it to the broker), for the broker itself I suggest using mosquitto, as its a free lightweight and opensource implementation of the MQTT protocol, you can find more information as well as download links and tutorials here [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org) , if you need any help setting anything up or for anythoing else fell free to contact me ! Thanks for everything, wish you guys all the best with the project !
